This examples shows how to run Rietveld - the code review tool available
at http://codereview.appspot.com/.

Before you are able to run this example you need to obtain a recent version
of Rietveld. There are two ways to do this. Either set it up manually or
use the Makefile in this directory.


Using the Makefile
==================

Just run

     make all

This will fetch a recent Django and Rietveld's sources directly from their
Subversion repositories. When it's finished run

    ./manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000

and point your browser to that location.


Manual Setup
============

Skip down to "Using the Makefile" if you don't want to setup this
example manually.

First check out Rietveld from Subversion by running

     svn co http://rietveld.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/codereview
     svn co http://rietveld.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/static
     svn co http://rietveld.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/templates

Then modify your checked out version of Rietveld by applying all patches
in the patches directory.

Now set a few symbolic links to include the helper and Django by running

    ln -s ../../django .
    ln -s ../../gae2django .
    ln -s ../../manage.py .

Finally run

    ./manage.py syncdb

to initialize the example database.
